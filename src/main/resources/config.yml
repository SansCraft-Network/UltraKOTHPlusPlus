# KOTH locations/regions
koth-locations:
  # Example KOTH region using coordinates and radius (COMMENTED OUT)
  # Remove the # symbols below to enable this example region
  # example:
  #   use-worldguard: false  # Use coordinate/radius based detection
  #   world: "world"
  #   x: 100
  #   y: 65
  #   z: 100
  #   radius: 10
  #   # region: ""  # Not used when use-worldguard is false
  
  # Example WorldGuard region (COMMENTED OUT)
  # Remove the # symbols below to enable this example region
  # kothplace:
  #   use-worldguard: true   # Use WorldGuard region detection
  #   world: "world"
  #   region: "kothplace"    # WorldGuard region name
  #   # x, y, z, radius are ignored when use-worldguard is true
  
  # ========================================
  # HOW TO CREATE KOTH REGIONS:
  # ========================================
  # 
  # METHOD 1: Coordinate/Radius Based
  # my_region_name:
  #   use-worldguard: false
  #   world: "world"          # World name
  #   x: 100                  # X coordinate of center
  #   y: 65                   # Y coordinate of center  
  #   z: 100                  # Z coordinate of center
  #   radius: 15              # Radius in blocks
  #
  # METHOD 2: WorldGuard Region Based
  # my_wg_region:
  #   use-worldguard: true
  #   world: "world"          # World name
  #   region: "my_wg_region"  # WorldGuard region name
  #
  # ========================================
  # IN-GAME REGION CREATION:
  # ========================================
  # You can also create regions in-game using commands:
  # /koth create <name> coords <radius>     - Create at your location
  # /koth create <name> worldguard <region> - Use existing WG region
  #
  # Add more KOTH locations here...
